It was broad day—eight or nine o’clock; the storm raging, in lieu of the batteries; and someone knocking and calling at my door.</p><p>‘What is the matter?’ I cried.</p><p>‘A wreck! Close by!’</p><p>I sprung out of bed, and asked, what wreck?</p><p>‘A schooner, from Spain or Portugal, laden with fruit and wine. Make haste, sir, if you want to see her! It’s thought, down on the beach, she’ll go to pieces every moment.’</p></div> </div>
