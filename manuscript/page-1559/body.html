I want to speak to you.’</p><p>Behold me, on my gallant grey, bending at the side of Miss Mills, with my hand upon the carriage door!</p><p>‘Dora is coming to stay with me. She is coming home with me the day after tomorrow. If you would like to call, I am sure papa would be happy to see you.’ What could I do but invoke a silent blessing on Miss Mills’s head, and store Miss Mills’s address in the securest corner of my memory! What could I do but tell Miss Mills, with grateful looks and fervent words, how much I appreciated her good offices, and what an inestimable value I set upon her friendship!</p></div> </div>
