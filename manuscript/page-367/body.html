<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> No face appeared, however; and being come to the house, and knowing how to open the door, before dark, without knocking, I went in with a quiet, timid step.</p><p>God knows how infantine the memory may have been, that was awakened within me by the sound of my motherâ€™s voice in the old parlour, when I set foot in the hall. She was singing in a low tone. I think I must have lain in her arms, and heard her singing so to me when I was but a baby. The strain was new to me, and yet it was so old that it filled my heart brim-full; like a friend come back from a long absence.</p></div> </div>
