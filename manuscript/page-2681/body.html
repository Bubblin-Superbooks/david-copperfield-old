<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>‘No, no! I am so rejoiced to see you, Trotwood!’</p><p>‘Dear Agnes, the happiness it is to me, to see you once again!’</p><p>I folded her to my heart, and, for a little while, we were both silent. Presently we sat down, side by side; and her angel-face was turned upon me with the welcome I had dreamed of, waking and sleeping, for whole years.</p><p>She was so true, she was so beautiful, she was so good,—I owed her so much gratitude, she was so dear to me, that I could find no utterance for what I felt. I tried to bless her, tried to thank her, tried to tell her (as I had often done in letters) what an influence she had upon me; but all my efforts were in vain. My love and joy were dumb.</p></div> </div>
