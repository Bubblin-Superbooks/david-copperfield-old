<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I was present myself, and I remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused, at a part of myself being disposed of in that way.

It is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there, that she was never drowned, but died triumphantly in bed, at ninety-two. I have understood that it was, to the last, her proudest boast, that she never had been on the water in her life, except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which she was extremely partial) she, to the last, expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and others, who had the presumption to go ‘meandering’ about the world.</p></div> </div>
