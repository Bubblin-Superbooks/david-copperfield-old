I can think of nothing. I firmly believe there is nothing. I hardly understand even what you mean.’</p><p>As she still stood looking fixedly at me, a twitching or throbbing, from which I could not dissociate the idea of pain, came into that cruel mark; and lifted up the corner of her lip as if with scorn, or with a pity that despised its object.</p></div> </div>
