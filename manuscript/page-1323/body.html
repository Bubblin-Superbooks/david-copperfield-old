This is a way of life which reminds me of the period when I was myself in a state of celibacy, and Mrs. Micawber had not yet been solicited to plight her faith at the Hymeneal altar.’</p><p>‘He means, solicited by him, Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, archly. ‘He cannot answer for others.’</p><p>‘My dear,’ returned Mr. Micawber with sudden seriousness, ‘I have no desire to answer for others.
