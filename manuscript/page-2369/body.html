In short, we had resolved to take this course, when Dora again unsettled us by declaring that she never would forgive herself, and never would forgive her bad boy, if my aunt remained behind, on any pretence.</p><p>‘I won’t speak to you,’ said Dora, shaking her curls at my aunt. ‘I’ll be disagreeable!
