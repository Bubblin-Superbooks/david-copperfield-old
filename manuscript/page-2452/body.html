But if I had been more fit to be married I might have made you more so, too. Besides, you are very clever, and I never was.’</p><p>‘We have been very happy, my sweet Dora.’</p><p>‘I was very happy, very. But, as years went on, my dear boy would have wearied of his child-wife. She would have been less and less a companion for him. He would have been more and more sensible of what was wanting in his home. She wouldn’t have improved. It is better as it is.’</p></div> </div>
