<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But one face, shining on me like a Heavenly light by which I see all other objects, is above them and beyond them all. And that remains.</p><p>I turn my head, and see it, in its beautiful serenity, beside me.</p><p>My lamp burns low, and I have written far into the night; but the dear presence, without which I were nothing, bears me company.</p><p>O Agnes, O my soul, so may thy face be by me when I close my life indeed; so may I, when realities are melting from me, like the shadows which I now dismiss, still find thee near me, pointing upward!</p></div> </div>
