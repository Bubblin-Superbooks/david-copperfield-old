<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>‘What’s the matter, Dora?’</p><p>Dora would look up hopelessly, and reply, ‘They won’t come right. They make my head ache so. And they won’t do anything I want!’</p><p>Then I would say, ‘Now let us try together.

If I tacitly checked this playfulness, and persisted, she would look so scared and disconsolate, as she became more and more bewildered, that the remembrance of her natural gaiety when I first strayed into her path, and of her being my child-wife, would come reproachfully upon me; and I would lay the pencil down, and call for the guitar.</p></div> </div>
