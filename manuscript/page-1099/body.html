Oh, I am not as good a girl as I ought to be. I am not, I know!’</p><p>Peggotty had hastened to the chair before the fire.

Mr. David, for the sake of old times, do, please, try to help me! I want to be a better girl than I am. I want to feel a hundred times more thankful than I do. I want to feel more, what a blessed thing it is to be the wife of a good man, and to lead a peaceful life. Oh me, oh me! Oh my heart, my heart!’</p></div> </div>
