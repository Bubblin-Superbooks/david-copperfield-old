<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Who is this bent lady, supporting herself by a stick, and showing me a countenance in which there are some traces of old pride and beauty, feebly contending with a querulous, imbecile, fretful wandering of the mind? She is in a garden; and near her stands a sharp, dark, withered woman, with a white scar on her lip. Let me hear what they say.</p><p>‘Rosa, I have forgotten this gentleman’s name.’</p><p>Rosa bends over her, and calls to her, ‘Mr. Copperfield.’</p><p>‘I am glad to see you, sir. I am sorry to observe you are in mourning. I hope Time will be good to you.’</p><p>Her impatient attendant scolds her, tells her I am not in mourning, bids her look again, tries to rouse her.</p></div> </div>
