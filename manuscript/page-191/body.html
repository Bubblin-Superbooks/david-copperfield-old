<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Let me remember how it used to be, and bring one morning back again.</p><p>I come into the second-best parlour after breakfast, with my books, and an exercise-book, and a slate. My mother is ready for me at her writing-desk, but not half so ready as Mr. Murdstone in his easy-chair by the window (though he pretends to be reading a book), or as Miss Murdstone, sitting near my mother stringing steel beads. The very sight of these two has such an influence over me, that I begin to feel the words I have been at infinite pains to get into my head, all sliding away, and going I donâ€™t know where. I wonder where they do go, by the by?</p></div> </div>
