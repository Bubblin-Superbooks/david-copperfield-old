<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If I could ever set this right! If I could ever work out his restoration, as I have so innocently been the cause of his decline!’</p><p>I had never before seen Agnes cry. I had seen tears in her eyes when I had brought new honours home from school, and I had seen them there when we last spoke about her father, and I had seen her turn her gentle head aside when we took leave of one another; but I had never seen her grieve like this. It made me so sorry that I could only say, in a foolish, helpless manner, ‘Pray, Agnes, don’t! Don’t, my dear sister!’</p><p>But Agnes was too superior to me in character and purpose, as I know well now, whatever I might know or not know then, to be long in need of my entreaties.</p></div> </div>
