Neither did I like to say, that I hoped he had not been too communicative to Uriah; or to inquire if they had talked much about me. I was afraid of hurting Mr. Micawber’s feelings, or, at all events, Mrs. Micawber’s, she being very sensitive; but I was uncomfortable about it, too, and often thought about it afterwards.</p><p>We had a beautiful little dinner.

There was wine, and there was strong ale; and after dinner Mrs. Micawber made us a bowl of hot punch with her own hands.</p></div> </div>
