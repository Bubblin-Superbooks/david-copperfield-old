Ever my guide, and best support! If you had been more mindful of yourself, and less of me, when we grew up here together, I think my heedless fancy never would have wandered from you. But you were so much better than I, so necessary to me in every boyish hope and disappointment, that to have you to confide in, and rely upon in everything, became a second nature, supplanting for the time the first and greater one of loving you as I do!’</p><p>Still weeping, but not sadly—joyfully! And clasped in my arms as she had never been, as I had thought she never was to be!</p></div> </div>
