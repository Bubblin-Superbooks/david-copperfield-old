My aunt, with her hands behind her, walked up and down the room, until the gentleman who had squinted at me from the upper window came in laughing.</p><p>‘Mr. Dick,’ said my aunt, ‘don’t be a fool, because nobody can be more discreet than you can, when you choose. We all know that. So don’t be a fool, whatever you are.’</p><p>The gentleman was serious immediately, and looked at me, I thought, as if he would entreat me to say nothing about the window.</p></div> </div>
