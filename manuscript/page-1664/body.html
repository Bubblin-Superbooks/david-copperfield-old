He took what she gave him, and no more—like a child—and we all three sat together at a window as the evening gathered in. When it was almost dark, he lay down on a sofa, Agnes pillowing his head and bending over him a little while; and when she came back to the window, it was not so dark but I could see tears glittering in her eyes.</p><p>I pray Heaven that I never may forget the dear girl in her love and truth, at that time of my life;</p></div> </div>
