You know what honour he has always done me. Not proud in his wisdom. Humble, humble—condescending even to poor Dick, who is simple and knows nothing. I have sent his name up, on a scrap of paper, to the kite, along the string, when it has been in the sky, among the larks. The kite has been glad to receive it, sir, and the sky has been brighter with it.’</p><p>I delighted him by saying, most heartily, that the Doctor was deserving of our best respect and highest esteem.</p></div> </div>
