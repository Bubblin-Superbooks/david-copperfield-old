<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Was it a selfish error that was leading me away? Or, having once a clue to hope, was there something opening to me that I had not dared to think of?</p><p>‘I must say more. I cannot let you leave me so! For Heaven’s sake, Agnes, let us not mistake each other after all these years, and all that has come and gone with them! I must speak plainly. If you have any lingering thought that I could envy the happiness you will confer; that I could not resign you to a dearer protector, of your own choosing; that I could not, from my removed place, be a contented witness of your joy; dismiss it, for I don’t deserve it! I have not suffered quite in vain. You have not taught me quite in vain. There is no alloy of self in what I feel for you.’</p></div> </div>
