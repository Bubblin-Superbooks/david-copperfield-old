Too bad!’ It was Traddles; whom Mr. Mell instantly discomfited by bidding him hold his tongue. —‘To insult one who is not fortunate in life, sir, and who never gave you the least offence, and the many reasons for not insulting whom you are old enough and wise enough to understand,’ said Mr. Mell, with his lips trembling more and more, ‘you commit a mean and base action.
