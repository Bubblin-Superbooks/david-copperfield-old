<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>‘What is it?’ I asked with a smile.</p><p>‘It’s a stupid name,’ she said, shaking her curls for a moment. ‘Child-wife.’</p><p>I laughingly asked my child-wife what her fancy was in desiring to be so called. She answered without moving, otherwise than as the arm I twined about her may have brought her blue eyes nearer to me:</p><p>‘I don’t mean, you silly fellow, that you should use the name instead of Dora. I only mean that you should think of me that way. When you are going to be angry with me, say to yourself, “it’s only my child-wife!” When I am very disappointing, say, “I knew, a long time ago, that she would make but a child-wife!” When you miss what I should like to be, and I think can never be, say, “still my foolish child-wife loves me!” For indeed I do.’</p></div> </div>
