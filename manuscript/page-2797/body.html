His table is covered with thick piles of papers; and I say, as I look around me:</p><p>‘If Sophy were your clerk, now, Traddles, she would have enough to do!’</p><p>‘You may say that, my dear Copperfield! But those were capital days, too, in Holborn Court! Were they not?’</p><p>‘When she told you you would be a judge? But it was not the town talk then!’</p></div> </div>
