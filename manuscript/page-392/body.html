She did it gloomily until she came to ten, but when she got into two figures she became more hopeful, and, as the time advanced, even jocular.</p><p>It was on this very first day that I had the misfortune to throw her, though she was not subject to such weakness in general, into a state of violent consternation. I came into the room where she and my mother were sitting; and the baby (who was only a few weeks old) being on my mother’s lap, I took it very carefully in my arms. Suddenly Miss Murdstone gave such a scream that I all but dropped it.</p></div> </div>
