<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There was a little altercation between her and Steerforth about a cast of the dice at back gammonâ€”when I thought her, for one moment, in a storm of rage; and then I saw it start forth like the old writing on the wall.</p><p>It was no matter of wonder to me to find Mrs. Steerforth devoted to her son. She seemed to be able to speak or think about nothing else. She showed me his picture as an infant, in a locket, with some of his baby-hair in it; she showed me his picture as he had been when I first knew him; and she wore at her breast his picture as he was now. All the letters he had ever written to her, she kept in a cabinet near her own chair by the fire; and she would have read me some of them, and I should have been very glad to hear them too, if he had not interposed, and coaxed her out of the design.</p></div> </div>
