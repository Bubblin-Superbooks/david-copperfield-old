After that, she covered her head up with her apron again and had another laugh about Mr. Barkis. After that, she took the baby out of its little cradle, and nursed it. After that, she cleared the dinner table; after that, came in with another cap on, and her work-box, and the yard-measure, and the bit of wax-candle, all just the same as ever.</p><p>We sat round the fire, and talked delightfully. I told them what a hard master Mr. Creakle was, and they pitied me very much.
