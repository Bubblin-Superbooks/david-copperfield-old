My friend Copperfield will perhaps do me the favour to check that total?’</p><p>I did so and found it correct.</p><p>‘To leave this metropolis,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘and my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles, without acquitting myself of the pecuniary part of this obligation, would weigh upon my mind to an insupportable extent.
