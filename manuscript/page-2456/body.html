<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>How the time wears, I know not; until I am recalled by my child-wife’s old companion. More restless than he was, he crawls out of his house, and looks at me, and wanders to the door, and whines to go upstairs.</p><p>‘Not tonight, Jip! Not tonight!’</p><p>He comes very slowly back to me, licks my hand, and lifts his dim eyes to my face.</p><p>‘Oh, Jip! It may be, never again!’</p><p>He lies down at my feet, stretches himself out as if to sleep, and with a plaintive cry, is dead.</p></div> </div>
